   ========================
	   
	 compareTo in Java is in the same league of equals() and hashcode() and used to implement natural order of object, compareTo is slightly different to compare() method of Comparator interface which is used to implement custom sorting order. 
	
	What is compareTo() method in Java
	
	compareTo() method is defined in interface java.lang.Comparable and it is used to implement natural sorting on java classes. natural sorting means the the sort order which naturally applies on object e.g. lexical order for String, numeric order for Integer or Sorting employee by there ID etc. most of the java core classes including String and Integer implements CompareTo() method and provide natural sorting.
	
	Why do you need CompareTo()
	
	How to write compareTo method in Object - Java ExampleSorting is an essential part of application development, which you often required to implement in your system. in Java sorting is implemented using Comparator and Comparable in Java. Since we store java objects in Collection there are also certain Set and Map which provides automating sorting when you insert element on that e.g. TreeSet and TreeMap. to implement sorting you need to override either compareTo(Object o) method or Comparable class or compare(Object o1, Object o2) method of Comparator class. Most of the classes implement Comparable to implement natural order. for example if you are writing Employee object you probably want to implement Comparable interface and override compareTo() method to compare current employee with other employee based on ID. So essentially you need to override compareTo() because you need to sort elements in ArrayList or any other Collection.
	
	How to implement compareTo in Java
	
	
	There are certain rules and important points to remember while overriding compareTo method:
	
	1) CompareTo method must return negative number if current object is less than other object, positive number if current object is greater than other object and zero if both objects are equal to each other.
	
	2) CompareTo must be in consistent with equals method e.g. if two objects are equal via equals() , there compareTo() must return zero otherwise if those objects are stored in SortedSet or SortedMap they will not behave properly. Since SortedSet or SortedMap use compareTo() to check the object if two unequal object are returned equal by compareTo those will not be added into Set or Map if they are not using external Comparator.  One example where compareTo is not consistent with equals in JDK is BigDecimal class. two BigDecimal number for which compareTo returns zero, equals returns false as clear from following BigDecimal comparison example:
	
	BigDecimal bd1 = new BigDecimal("2.0");
	BigDecimal bd2 = new BigDecimal("2.00");
	      
	System.out.println("comparing BigDecimal using equals: " + bd1.equals(bd2));
	System.out.println("comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: " + bd1.compareTo(bd2));
	
	Output:
	comparing BigDecimal using equals: false
	comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: 0
	 
	How does it affect BigDecimal ? well if you store these two BigDecimal in HashSet you will end up with duplicates (violation of Set Contract) i.e. two elements while if you store them in TreeSet you will end up with just 1 element because HashSet uses equals to check duplicates while TreeSet uses compareTo to check duplicates. That's why its suggested to keep compareTo consistent with equals method in java.
	
	3) CompareTo() must throw NullPointerException if current object get compared to null object as opposed to equals() which return false on such scenario.
	
	4) Another important point to note is don't use subtraction for comparing integral values because result of subtraction can overflow as every int operation in Java is modulo 2^32. use either Integer.compareTo()  or logical operators for comparison. There is one scenario where you can use subtraction to reduce clutter and improve performance. As we know compareTo doesn't care magnitude, it just care whether result is positive or negative. While comparing two integral fields you can use subtraction if you are absolutely sure that both operands are positive integer or more precisely there different must be less than Integer.MAX_VALUE. In this case there will be no overflow and your compareTo will be concise and faster.
	
	5. Use relational operator to compare integral numeric value i.e. < or > but use Float.compareTo() or Double.compareTo() to compare floating point number as relational operator doesn't obey contract of compareTo for floating point numbers.
	
	6. CompareTo() method is for comparison so order in which you compare two object matters. If you have more than one significant field to compare than always start comparing from most significant field to least significant field. here compareTo is different with equals because in case of equality check order doesn't matter. like in above example of compareTo if we don't consider Id and compare two student by its name and age than name should be first compare and than age, so if two student have same name one that has higher age should result in greater.
	
	Student john12 = new Student(1001, "John", 12);
	Student john13 = new Student(1002, "John", 13);
	      
	//compareTo will return -1 as age of john12 is less than john13
	System.out.println("comparing John, 12 and John, 13 with compareTo :" + john12.compareTo(john13));
	
	Output:
	comparing John, 12 and John, 13 with compareTo :-1
	
	7. Another important point while comparing String using compareTo is to consider case. just like equals() doesn't consider case, compareTo also do not consider case, if you want to compare regardless of case than use String.compareToIgnoreCase() as we have used in above example.
	
	
	
	Where compareTo() method used in Java
	---------------------------------------------------
	In Java API compareTo() method is used in SortedSet e.g. TreeSet and SortedMap e.g. TreeMap for sorting elements on natural order if no explicit Comparator is passed to Collections.sort() method e.g.
	
	List stocks = getListOfStocks(); 
	Collections.sort(stocks);
	
	as mentioned earlier if compareTo is not consistent with equals then it could produce strange result. let took another example you put Stock A and Stock B on StockSet which is a TreeSet. Both Stock A and Stock B are equal by equals() method but compareTo return non zero values for it which makes that StockB will also be landed into TreeSet which was voilation of Set itself because it is not supposed to allow duplicates.
	
	
	
	******************************Comparable and comparator Interface in Java************************************
	
Comparable interface: Class whose objects to be sorted must implement this interface.In this,we have to implement compareTo(Object) method.
For example:
===========================================================
1
public class Country implements Comparable{
2
       @Override
3
    public int compareTo(Object arg0) {
4
        Country country=(Country) arg0;
5
        return (this.countryId < country.countryId ) ? -1: (this.countryId > country.countryId ) ? 1:0 ;
6
}}

===========================================================

If any class implements comparable inteface then collection of that object can be sorted automatically using Collection.sort() or Arrays.sort().Object will be sort on the basis of compareTo method in that class.
Objects which implement Comparable in java can be used as keys in a SortedMap like TreeMap or SortedSet like TreeSet without implementing any other interface.
Comparator interface: Class whose objects to be sorted do not need to implement this interface.Some third class can implement this interface to sort.e.g.CountrySortByIdComparator class can implement Comparator interface to sort collection of country object by id. For example:

===========================================================
1
public class CountrySortByIdComparator implements Comparator<Country>{
2
 
3
    @Override
4
    public int compare(Country country1, Country country2) {
5
 
6
        return (country1.getCountryId() < country2.getCountryId() ) ? -1: (country1.getCountryId() > country2.getCountryId() ) ? 1:0 ;
7
    }
8
 
9
}

===========================================================
Using Comparator interface,we can write different sorting based on different attributes of objects to be sorted.You can use anonymous comparator to compare at particular line of code. For example:

===========================================================
01
        Country indiaCountry=new Country(1, 'India');
02
        Country chinaCountry=new Country(4, 'China');
03
        Country nepalCountry=new Country(3, 'Nepal');
04
        Country bhutanCountry=new Country(2, 'Bhutan');
05
 
06
        List<Country> listOfCountries = new ArrayList<Country>();
07
        listOfCountries.add(indiaCountry);
08
        listOfCountries.add(chinaCountry);
09
        listOfCountries.add(nepalCountry);
10
        listOfCountries.add(bhutanCountry);
11
 
12
//Sort by countryName
13
 
14
           Collections.sort(listOfCountries,new Comparator<Country>() {
15
 
16
               @Override
17
               public int compare(Country o1, Country o2) {
18
 
19
                   return o1.getCountryName().compareTo(o2.getCountryName());
20
               }
21
           });
	   
===========================================================	   

Difference between comparable and comparator interface:-

Comparable:-
-------------------
Sorting logic:-	Sorting logic must be in same class whose objects are being sorted. 
                Hence this is called natural ordering of objects.
                
Implementation:-Class whose objects to be sorted must implement this interface.e.g 
                Country class needs to implement comparable to collection of country 
                object by id
                
                

Sorting method:- int compareTo(Object o1)
                   This method compares this object with o1 object and returns a integer.
                   Its value has following meaning
             1. positive – this object is greater than o1
             2. zero – this object equals to o1
             3. negative – this object is less than o1
             
Calling method:-	Collections.sort(List)
                    Here objects will be sorted on the basis of CompareTo method
                    
                    
Package:-   	Java.lang.Comparable



Comparator:-
-------------------

Sorting logic:-	Sorting logic is in separate class. Hence we can write different 
               sorting based on different attributes of objects to be sorted.
                E.g. Sorting using id,name etc.
                
Implementation:-Class whose objects to be sorted do not need to implement this interface.
                Some other class can implement this interface. 
                E.g.-CountrySortByIdComparator class can implement Comparator interface to 
                sort collection of country object by id
                
                

Sorting method:- int compare(Object o1,Object o2)
                This method compares o1 and o2 objects. and returns a integer.
                Its value has following meaning.
               1. positive – o1 is greater than o2
               2. zero – o1 equals to o2
               3. negative – o1 is less than o1
             
Calling method:- Collections.sort(List, Comparator)
                 Here objects will be sorted on the basis of Compare method in Comparator
                    
                    
Package:-   	Java.lang.Comparator
