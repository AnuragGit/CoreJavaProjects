finalize() method :-
------------------------
        protected void finalize() ;
        
  1.  This method is calling by garbage collector whenever object is removing from memory.
  
  2.  All abandand object are eligible for garbage collector . If Object doesn't have any 
      reference in memory that object is known as abandand object.
      
  3.  Whenever GC is calling to finalize() method then only abandand object is removing from
      memory. If we will call finalize() method then it won't remove.
      
  4. GC call finalize() method maximum only once it can be zero time but not more than one time.
  
  5. GC is Demon thread so it has very less priority .
  
  6. There are two way to call GC Explicit way
  
        a. System.gc();
        b. Runtime.getRuntime().gc();
        
    But there is no guarantee to GC call will occurs.
