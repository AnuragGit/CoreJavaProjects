 * @author Anurag
 *    
 *    Concept:-
 *    
 *        1.Constructor should have a same name of class name but method can have any name 
 *          including class name.
 *          
 *        2. Constructor should not have a return type.Method should have return type.
 *        
 *        3. Constructor are not inherited to the subclass, Method can be inherited to subclass.
 *        
 *        4.Constructor can not be static , Method can be static.
 *        
 *        5.Constructor can not abstract , Method can be abstract.
 *        
 *        6.Constructor should not be final but method can be final.
 *        
 *        7.Constructor first statement always super() or this() calling statement but Mehtod first
 *          statement can be any statement.
 *          
 *        8. Every class should have minimum one constructor ,we can develop a class without method also
 *        
 *        9.In case of Constructor we can not perform either recursion or cyclic  calling ,But in case 
 *          of method both cyclic and recursion can be perform .
 *        
 *        10. Constructor are not involving in polymorphism  ,method are involving in polymorphism.
 *        
 *        11.The main goal of the constructor is construct initial state of a object with a desired value.
