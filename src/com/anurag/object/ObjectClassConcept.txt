 Object Class:-
 
           It is super most class of the all the classes. It is available in java.lang.package.Object class
           contain several method.
           
           public java.lang.String toString();
           public boolean equals(java.lang.object);
           public native int hashcode();
           protected void finalize();
           public final native java.lang.Class getClass();
           
           
 Object class method importance:-
 ===============================
 
   Equals and HashCode methods in Java are two fundamental methods from java.lang.Object class,
   which is used to compare equality of objects, primarily inside hash based collections such 
   as Hashtable and HashMap. Both equals() and hashCode() are defined in java.lang.Object 
   class and there default implementation is based upon Object information 
   e.g. default equals() method return true, if two objects are exactly same
   i.e. they are pointing to same memory address, while default implementation of 
   hashcode method return int and implemented as native method. Similar default 
   implementation of toString() method, returns type of class, followed by memory 
   address in hex String. It's advised to override these method, based upon logical 
   and business rules e.g. String overrides equals to check equality of  two String 
   based upon content.
