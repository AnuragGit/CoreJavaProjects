Cloning Operation:- 
=====================
           Cloning operation is a one of the unsecure  operation so 
    By default runtime environment not allow to do unsecure operation.
    In order to do the unsecured operation we require a mark . The mark can be provide through
    one of the marker interface.
    
    Signature of clone method:-
    
                   protected Object clone throws CloneNotSupportedException
                   
 1. It is a protected so we can use only the same class that is inherited class.
 2. DownCasting require.
 3. It is throw one of the Checked exception.
 4. To make duplicate object clonable doesn't have even any single method.
 
 
 Shallow Copy and Deep Copy:-
 =============================
 
      Deep Copy :-
      =============
       So changes in the original object is not effecting to the clone 
      Object , so both are 100 % disjoints and This operation is called Deep Copy.
      
      If attributes are primitive or immutable objects then clone do deep copy operation
      
      Shallow Copy :-
      ===============
            Any mutable and Derived Data type except  Wrapper Class clone method 
            perform shallow copy.Shallow means not 100% disjoint.
