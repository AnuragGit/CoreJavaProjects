String class Concept:-
=========================

  To represent multiple character there are different way
        (1) Character Array
        (2) By using String Object                                      
        (3) By using String Buffer Object
        (4) By using String Builder Object
        
  To represent through character array is little difficult . The best way is String object or 
  String Buffer or String Builder.
  
    (1) String Object are immutable.
    (2) String Buffer and String Builder are mutable.
    (3) String , StringBuffer and StringBuilder are all three available on java.lang package.
    (4) All three are final classes.
    (5) In All three toString() method got override.
    (6) In only String class hashcode() and equals() method got override.
    (7) String class implementing comparable interface because of this String object can be Sorted.
    (8) StringBuffer and StringBuilder are not implementing comparable interface.
    (9) All three classes implementing Serializable interface.

    
    
  String Constant Pool:-
  ========================
  It is a special place where the collection of references to string objects are placed. 
    If we declare any string something like ::
    String s1="abc";
    Then it will be stored in constant pool 
    now if again we will declare String s2="abc";
    Then it will be first search like if this constant already available on pool or not ,if it found
    then same "abc" will get assign back with new reference variable S2.
    
  Non Constant pool:-
  ===================
  
  If we declare variable like 
  
  String s= new String("abc");
  
  then it will always store in heap and heap is non constant pool.
  
 The Difference between  StringBuffer and String   :-
 ===================================================
 
 (1) In String class toString and equals and hashcode method got override. 
     But in case of StringBuffer only toString method got override.
     
 (2) Hash related container can be identify the duplicate in case of String Objects.
     But in case of StringBuffer object hashrealted container  can not identify duplicate
     because hashcode and equals method not overried here.
     
 (3) String Object are immutable , we can not change once it created.
     But StringBuffer Object are mutable we can change the content after creation also.
     
 (4) String class is implementing comparable interface ,So we can sort String object based
     on the content.
     But StringBuffer not implemented comparable interface so we can not sort StringBuffer 
     Object.
     
  (5) String class not managing any buffer but StringBuilder is managing the buffer internally.
  
  (6) String buffer is not synchronized one .
      But StringBuilder is Synchronized one.
      
   (7) Inside the String class reverse and delete method not avilable.
       But StringBuffer having reverse and delete method.
       
       
   The Difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder:-
   ========================================================
   
   (1) String Buffer is Synchronized 
       But StringBuilder is not Synchronized.
       
    (2) StringBuffer is introduce in jdk 1.0
         But String Builder is introduce in jdk 1.5
         
     (3) StringBuffer performance is low but accuracy is high.
         But StringBuilder performance is high but accuracy is low.
