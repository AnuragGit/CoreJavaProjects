Converting one datatype to another datatype  is knows as casting.
There are two type of casting.
1.primitive casting
2.derived casting.

1.primitive casting:-  

                  converting one numeric primitive to another numeric primitive .
                  
2.Derived casting:-  
               
                    Converting one derived data type to another derived data type which are
                    same hierarchy , same type and same inheritance.
                    
 Primitive Casting:-
 
             There are also two types:
             
             a) Auto widening 
             b) Explicit narrowing
             
      a) Auto widening :-   
      
                    byte< short < int < long < float < double 
                    
                    wider most is double
                    narrow most is byte.
