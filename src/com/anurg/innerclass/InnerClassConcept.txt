Inner Class:-

         Defining a class inside another class is knows as inner class.
         
         two concept:-
            1) non static member can not be use inside static block  directly ,but  by reference variable
              we can use it.
            
            2)static variable can be use any where in the class.
            
        There are four type of inner classes 
        
        static inner class
        non static inner class
        local inner class
        Anonymous inner class
        
        
        static inner class:-  In static inner class we can able to declare static and non static both member.
        non static inner class:- In side non static inner class we can not declare and define static member.
        
        So any kind of class we can declare non static member.
        
        
        local inner class :- local inner class can not be declare along with access specifiers
                             but it can be final.  
                             
                             1) Inside local inner class we can not define any static member but outer class
                             static member can be use in  innerclass.
                             
                             2) Inside local inner class we can use only local final variable.
                             
                             3) local inner class is not used in outside a current definition block.
                             
         Anonymous inner class:- This class don't have any name.
